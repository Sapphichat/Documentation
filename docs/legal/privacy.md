# Privacy Policy

!!! info "Last updated: August 3, 2025"

## Overview

Sapphichat is a decentralized and federated platform. This Privacy Policy explains how information is handled within our network and clarifies the data practices of our team and the broader federation.

## Data Collection by Sapphichat Team

**We do not collect, store, or process any personal data.** As the developers of Sapphichat, our team:

- Does not operate centralized servers that store user data
- Does not track user activity across the network
- Does not collect analytics or usage statistics
- Does not store user profiles, messages, or metadata
- Does not use cookies or tracking technologies

## Decentralized Nature

Sapphichat operates on a federated model where:

- Each instance/server is operated independently by different administrators
- Data is stored locally on the instance you choose to join
- Your data remains under the control of your chosen instance administrator
- We have no access to or control over data on individual instances

## What Instance Administrators May Collect

When you join a Sapphichat instance, the instance administrator may collect and store:

- Account information (username, email, profile details)
- Messages and content you post
- Connection and activity logs
- Technical information (IP addresses, device information)

!!! warning "Important"
    Each instance has its own privacy policy and data handling practices. **Please review the privacy policy of your chosen instance.**


## Data Sharing in Federation

Due to the federated nature of Sapphichat:

- Your messages in groups may be shared with other federated instances (if the group is public and members of the group are from different instances)
- Other instances may cache your public content
- Private messages are only shared with intended recipients' instances
- Instance administrators control what data their instance shares

## Your Rights and Choices

- **Choose Your Instance:** Select an instance whose privacy practices align with your preferences
- **Data Portability:** You can export your data and move to another instance
- **Content Control:** You control the visibility of your posts (public, private, direct)
- **Account Deletion:** Contact your instance administrator to delete your account

## Open Source Transparency

Sapphichat is open source software:

- The code is publicly available for audit
- Security researchers can review our privacy implementations
- No hidden data collection mechanisms exist in the codebase

## Contact Information

For questions about this privacy policy or Sapphichat's development please [this page](../contact.md).

For data-related inquiries about your specific account, please contact your instance administrator directly.

## Changes to This Policy

This privacy policy may be updated to reflect changes in our development practices or legal requirements. Check the "Last updated" date at the top of this page for the most recent version.

## Third-Party Services

Individual instances may use third-party services (hosting providers, CDNs, etc.). These services have their own privacy policies that instance administrators should disclose to their users.
