Sapphichat is a modern communication platform (that doesn't exist yet...) designed for secure and efficient messaging.

!!! warning "Sapphichat is in work in process, we need your help!"
    This documentation is a work in progress. If you find any issues or have suggestions, please contribute to the project on GitHub.
    This project is relatively new, and we are looking for contributors to help us improve it.

This documentation will help you understand how to use Sapphichat and SapphiTalk effectively.

## Our goal

Not like Matrix, or other messaging protocols (where you need more than 4 or more docker containers to run it 💀), we want Sapphichat to be simple to deploy on a server, by running a single command and connect to the server with a client to configure it with a GUI, you can have access to a fully functional chat server with federation if you configure it to allow it.

## Sapphichat software structure

Our goal is to provide a complete chat solution, including:
